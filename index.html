      <h1>Hi, Iâ€™m Harsh ðŸ‘‹</h1>
      <p>
        From discovering Python and web development during school to diving into real-world electronics, cybersecurity, and full stack projects, my journey has been driven by curiosity and passion for building things that actually work.  
        Iâ€™m currently pursuing my BCA while learning and creating with tools like React, Node.js, Express, and MongoDB. I enjoy working across the full stack â€” from crafting user interfaces to building secure, scalable backend systems.  
        Lately, Iâ€™ve been sharpening my programming fundamentals through DSA and exploring how security really works under the hood.
